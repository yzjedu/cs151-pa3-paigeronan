the purpose of this was to make a program that draws designs based off of user input. Practiced with error checking and
looping and also functions. For this project I really had to break it down and work in small sections and then combine 
them to create the program. I started with figuring out what functions I wanted to do, so I split it up into the three 
different designs that the user can choose from. I learned more from this project by having to work by myself without 
help. I found it difficult at times with all the looping and error checking and making it have good HCI. But I enjoyed 
having to be creative and figure it out by myself.
